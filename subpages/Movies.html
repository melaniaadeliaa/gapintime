    <div class="maintext">
      <h1 class="heading">Netflix and 80’s</h1>
<p class="paragraph"> I feel like most people’s favorite activity nowadays is to watch movies and tv shows, if this is the case for you too, there are some movies and tv series out there that could not only entertain you but also inspire you. </p>
      <h3> 1.	The breakfast club</h3>

      <div class="image_wrap">
        <img class="content_images" src="../images/movie1.jpg" alt="The breakfast club" width="700px">
      </div>

<p class="paragraph2"> Probably the best and the most well-known 80’s movies. Personally, I would rank it as the best. It’s a light movie bringing back all the high-school clichee life, a movie that might never go old dispite the age of it. </p>

      <h3>2.	Ghostbusters</h3>

      <div class="image_wrap">
        <img class="content_images" src="../images/movie2.jpg" alt="Ghostbusters" width="700px">
      </div>

      <p class="paragraph2">Ghostbusters is another iconic pick. Its genre is Fantasy/comedy and it consists of adventures fighting the supranatural. This movie was a cultural phenomen and it even has a 2016 rendition with all female leads. </p>

      <h3> 3. Dirty dancing </h3>

      <div class="image_wrap">
        <img class="content_images" src="../images/movie3.png" alt="Dirty dancing" width="700px">
      </div>

<p class="paragraph2"> Another extremelly well-known movie would be the romantic movie Dirty dancing. With an amazing story and beautiful dance coregraphies, the movie is still loved ‘till this day. </p>

      <h3>5.	Stranger Things</h3>
      <div class="image_wrap">
        <img class="content_images" src="../images/movie4.jpg" alt="Stranger things" width="700px">
      </div>

<p class="paragraph2">Ok so this one is not a movie, nor was it made in the 80’s but it’s a phenomen tv show pitched in 2016, and the entire action of the show pictures 1980’s atmosphere and fashion perfectly. Besides that, it’s a really good show and everyone should give it a try. </p>
