    <meta name="description" content="Find more about 80's style, music and movies on this page. Do you ever wonder how the past is connected to everything that we do and wear today? The reality is that we rarely even come up with new ideas, especially when we’re talking about fashion, but we are just creating new versions of what is already done, which is not at all a bad thing." />

      <h1 class="heading">Netflix and 80s</h1>
<p class="paragraph"> I feel like most people’s favorite activity nowadays is to watch movies and tv shows, if this is the case for you too, there are some movies and tv series out there that could not only entertain you but also inspire you. </p>
      <h3> 1.	The breakfast club</h3>

      <div class="image_wrap">
        <img class="content_images" src="../images/movie1.jpg" alt="The breakfast club" >
      </div>

<p class="paragraph2"> Probably the best and the most well-known 80s movies. Personally, I would rank it as the best. It’s a light movie bringing back all the high-school cliché life, a movie that might never go old despite the age of it.</p>

      <h3>2.	Ghostbusters</h3>

      <div class="image_wrap">
        <img class="content_images" src="../images/movie2.jpg" alt="Ghostbusters">
      </div>

      <p class="paragraph2">Ghostbusters is another iconic pick. Its genre is Fantasy/comedy and it consists of adventures fighting the supranatural. This movie was a cultural phenomen and it even has a 2016 rendition with all female leads. </p>

      <h3> 3. Dirty dancing </h3>

      <div class="image_wrap">
        <img class="content_images" src="../images/movie3.png" alt="Dirty dancing">
      </div>

<p class="paragraph2"> Another extremely well-known movie would be the romantic movie Dirty dancing. With an amazing story and beautiful dance choreography, the movie is still loved ‘till this day.</p>

      <h3>5.	Stranger Things</h3>
      <div class="image_wrap">
        <img class="content_images" src="../images/movie4.jpg" alt="Stranger things" >
      </div>

<p class="paragraph2">Ok so this one is not a movie, nor was it made in the 80s but it’s a phenomen tv show pitched in 2016, and the entire action of the show pictures 1980s atmosphere and fashion perfectly. Besides that, it’s a really good show and everyone should give it a try. </p>
