The reality is that we rarely even come up with new ideas, especially when we’re talking about fashion, but we are just creating new versions of what is already done, which is not at all a bad thing."/>

      <h1 class="heading">We all want to stand out, don’t we?</h1>
      <p class="paragraph">The 1980s definitely left a mark on our clothing style nowadays, bringing in so many fun clothing trends but also some trends that we would like to leave behind (talking about mulettes right here). </p>
      <p class="paragraph"> Because 80s means such a long period of time, the style can be divided in many categories and groups of people. The ones that we might say stand out the most though, are punk style and the aerobic craze.</p>
      <p class="paragraph2 "> At the beginning of 1980s, the style was more low-key than it was about to be for the next years, women wanting to express the look of success, wearing nice clothes to work and faux gold wearings and pearls when they got the chance. </p>

      <p class="paragraph2"> After the disco phase, clothes became more unisex and not so heavily accessorized for a short period of time. We all need a break sometimes, and this is even reflected trough fashion evolution as well.</p>
      <p class="paragraph2">Common clothes wore trough 1980 and 1983 are turtle-necks, knee-high boots, high wasted jeans and trousers. </p>
      <p class="paragraph2"> The aerobic craze literally made people go crazy. All the colors, the ripped clothes, the headbands, feet warmers and everything that made this trend a whole, made it seem like an all day long party for everyone.</p>

      </div>
      <p class="paragraph2">“Gym clothes” were worn even as street wear. Tracksuits, leggings, legwarmers, bold colors and big jewelry seemed to be people’s favorite at that time.</p>
      <p class="paragraph2">On the opposite spectrum, the punk era brought a lot of dark clothes and eye shadow, rebellious style, dark eye shadow, crazy hair consisting of colorful Mohawks or shaved head, doc martens. The style can be described as raw, angry and intimidating and it is encouraged by punk music. See more about 80s music <a class="hyperlink1" href="../subpages/Music.html">here</a> </p>
