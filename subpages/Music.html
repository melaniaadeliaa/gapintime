      <p class="paragraph"> People are constantly evolving, and so is technology. When CDs started to come in, so did music videos and excessive vibes. 80’s were colorful and diverse, and believe it or not, this decade made up for a golden era in
        pop, rock and hip hop music.</p>

      <p class="paragraph2"> Madonna was one of the first female artists to shine so bright in the lights of the stage. Sometimes, we even associate her with this decade because of her success back in the days.
        She revolutionized dance-pop music, coming out with her first album in early 80’s, including the memorable hit songs from “Holiday” to “Borderline”. She, of course, continued to come out with songs such as “Like a virgin”, “Open your heart”
        etc.

      <p class="paragraph2">We cannot forget about the king of pop himself, Michael Jackson. After releasing “Off the wall” at the end of 1970’s, he came up with the album “Thriller” (1982) in collaboration with Quincy Jones, which became the
        best-selling album of all times, so it deffinetly left a mark.</p>
